# Simple Calculator Project
## Project Objective
The Tkinter Calculator is a user-friendly desktop application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It serves as a simple, interactive, and efficient tool to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
## Features:
# User Interface:
  a.  A clean and visually appealing layout with neatly arranged buttons for digits and operations.

  b.  A responsive text entry field that displays the current input and results.
#	Core Functionalities:
  a. 	Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

  b.  Support for clearing the input and resetting the calculator using a "Clear" button.

  c.  Real-time display of input and computed results.
#	Interactive Elements:
  a.  Digit buttons (0-9) for easy number entry.

  b. 	Operation buttons (+, -, *, /) for mathematical calculations.

  c. 	An = button to display the computed result.
#	Responsive Design:
  a. 	Button clicks dynamically update the input display.

  b. 	Error handling for invalid inputs, such as division by zero or empty fields.
## Technical Highlights:
  • 	Programming Language: Python

  • 	Library Used: Tkinter (for GUI components)

  • 	Layout Management: Grid layout for systematic arrangement of buttons and fields.

  • 	Event Handling: Use of callback functions to handle button clicks and perform calculations.
